# Game-Craft Guides {#craft}

The API tutorials teach you **how to call** the SDK. These guides teach you
**how to decide** — the seam between "I know the sprite API" and "I shipped a
small game." They are hardware-grounded design advice, not reference: for the
registers and exact hardware behaviour, see @ref snes_graphics_guide.

## The philosophy

Two ideas run through every guide here:

1. **Constraints are creative fuel.** The SNES gives you 8 background modes,
   64 KB of VRAM, 256 colours, and 32 sprites per scanline. Those are not
   walls to memorise and resent — they are the design language of the machine.
   Every classic you remember was *shaped* by them. We frame each limit as a
   lever, not a ceiling.
2. **Link the universal, own the SNES-specific.** Camera design, "game feel,"
   and why the PPU works as it does are already explained brilliantly
   elsewhere — we link that gold-standard material rather than rewrite it, and
   spend our words on the one thing nobody else covers: *how to do it on real
   SNES hardware*, with this SDK.

## The guides

- @subpage craft_planning — **Planning your SNES game.** Budget your VRAM,
  CGRAM and sprites *before* you draw a pixel; choose a background mode from
  your genre, not a spec sheet; scope a first game you can actually finish.
- @subpage craft_backgrounds — **Composing with backgrounds & layers.** How
  to use BG1/BG2/BG3 and sprites together for parallax, HUDs, foreground
  occlusion — as composition decisions, anchored to working examples.
- @subpage craft_frame_budget — **The frame budget.** What one frame can do at
  60 Hz: the VBlank DMA budget, the sprite-per-line limit, CPU time, and when
  30 fps is the right call. The *time* companion to Planning's *space*.

*(More on the way: tiles → levels, and per-technique craft companions.)*

Every number in these guides traces to one of these; when we say "≈4 KB per
VBlank" or "32 sprites per line," this is where it comes from:
