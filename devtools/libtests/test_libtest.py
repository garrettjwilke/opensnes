"""Runtime assertions for lib/source functions (libtest.sfc).

Builds nothing — assumes `make` produced libtest.sfc. Resolves each result
global from the .sym and asserts its WRAM value via `luna state --assert`.
This is the execution gate the library lacks: examples only exercise lib
functions transitively, and the visual-regression hash can't see a wrong
return value that doesn't change pixels.

Vectors covered (see main.c):
  - math: div16/mod16 (incl. divisor-0 contract and the 65535/1 worst
    case of the old O(quotient) loop), mul16, sqrt16
  - text: cursor_y wrap — the tilemapBuffer overflow guard
